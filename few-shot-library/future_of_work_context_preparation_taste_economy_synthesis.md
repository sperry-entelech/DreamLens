## Business Tactics

### Context Preparation as Primary Service Offering
- **Tactic**: Position your economic value as preparing high-quality context (examples, reference libraries, curated datasets) for AI models rather than building the models or workflows themselves
- **Description**: The construction of workflows is commoditized - the differentiation is in the quality of examples and reference materials fed into those workflows. Finding, selecting, and formatting high-quality examples IS the economically valuable work
- **Context**: "It's no longer the construction of the workflow that matters. It's me building a really good prompt. And the way I build a really good prompt is I need to find really high-quality examples and format those examples in a way that the model understands"

### Few-Shot Example Curation Methodology
- **Tactic**: Systematically scroll through real-world outputs (emails, ads, designs, workflows) and select high-quality examples to feed into AI prompts
- **Description**: The actual work is browsing Gmail inboxes, Facebook ad libraries, social media feeds, and existing workflow repositories to identify candidates that represent the quality standard you want AI to replicate
- **Context**: "What's the work actually look like? Well, it literally is scrolling through a Gmail inbox or having your agent pull you up a bunch of candidates and then just selecting them"

### Human-in-the-Loop QA as Service Model
- **Tactic**: Offer AI-generated volume combined with human quality selection as a complete service delivery model
- **Description**: Generate 10x-100x the output using AI, then apply human taste to select the top performers. The generation is cheap and fast; the selection is the valuable human contribution
- **Context**: "The game optimal strategy to use AI models nowadays is basically: generate lots of stuff, and then you just have a human do QA - quality assurance. Generate 10,000 things and the human just picks the five best ones"

### Reference Library Development for Clients
- **Tactic**: Build and maintain high-quality reference libraries (images, copy samples, workflow JSONs, tone-of-voice examples) as ongoing deliverables for clients
- **Description**: A curated reference library of high-quality examples is the most valuable asset in any AI-powered workflow because it directly determines output quality. This is a recurring, maintainable service
- **Context**: "A big chunk of why that thumbnail generator works is because we have a very high quality reference library of images"

### Workflow JSON as Portable Context
- **Tactic**: Copy and collect N8N/Make.com workflow JSONs as few-shot examples for AI-assisted workflow building
- **Description**: When building automation, the highest-value activity is curating a library of proven workflow JSONs that represent maintainable, well-logged, error-handled flows - then using those as context for AI to generate new workflows
- **Context**: "In the case of N8N workflows, a lot of the time that is simply copying the workflow JSON... I'm applying my human intuition to know what flows are good, which flows probably need some work"

### Taste-as-a-Service Positioning
- **Tactic**: Market yourself not as a builder but as someone with calibrated taste who can ensure AI outputs align with what humans actually want
- **Description**: The ability to predict whether other humans will respond positively to content, design, copy, or systems IS the scarce economic resource. Position accordingly
- **Context**: "The most economically valuable tasks in the future are going to be nothing but using that taste skill over and over again to maximize the probability that some AI or machine generated output aligns with what human beings want"

### Voice Transcription Design Pattern for Rapid Context Dumping
- **Tactic**: Use voice transcription tools to rapidly dump context into AI coding or workflow environments rather than carefully structuring inputs
- **Description**: 30-60 seconds of spoken context, trusting the model to organize and structure, replaces careful manual input formatting - speeds up context preparation significantly
- **Context**: "They'll just turn on their little voice transcription tool and then talk a ton... 30 to 60 seconds of just what's up here and then trust that the model will organize that"

## Performance Benchmarks

### Few-Shot Accuracy Improvement
- **Metric**: ~5% accuracy improvement from zero-shot to one-shot; ~10% additional improvement from one-shot to few-shot
- **Value**: Consistent across model sizes, with gap widening as parameter count increases
- **Context**: "As we go from zero to one shot, there's somewhere about a 5% improvement in accuracy. As we go from one to few shot, there's something like a 10% improvement in accuracy"

### AI Generation Speed Multiplier
- **Metric**: 16x time improvement - 4 outputs in 25% of the time of 1 manual output
- **Value**: Demonstrates the volume advantage even when only 50% of outputs meet quality standards
- **Context**: "Despite the fact that we can generate four of these designs in a quarter of the time it used to take us to do even one - that's a 16 times improvement in time"

### Thumbnail Generation Speed
- **Metric**: 8 thumbnail variations generated in 5-10 seconds vs. 1 hour+ for manual creation
- **Value**: Orders of magnitude improvement enabling selection-based workflow over creation-based workflow
- **Context**: "This is more output than I realistically feasibly would have been able to do in probably an hour. And I did this in maybe 5 or 10 seconds"

### Agency Revenue Context
- **Metric**: $70,000/month automation agency revenue
- **Value**: Revenue achieved primarily through email autoresponder and similar automation builds - the same work now being transformed by context preparation approach
- **Context**: "I scaled an agency to $70,000 a month doing this sort of thing"

### Quality Gap Reality
- **Metric**: 95% to 99% quality represents a massive gulf despite appearing as only 4% difference
- **Value**: The gap between "pretty good" AI output and production-ready output is where human taste creates disproportionate economic value
- **Context**: "The difference between 95% and 99% though objectively it may look like only 4% is actually a gulf in quality as any design professional, creative or copywriter knows"

## General Insights

### The Knowledge Economy Has Become the Taste Economy
- **Insight**: The primary human economic contribution is shifting from knowing things or building things to exercising taste - the ability to predict what other humans will respond to
- **Description**: Previously, knowing how to build something was valuable. Now AI can build. What it can't reliably do is determine which of its outputs humans will prefer. That judgment IS the new economy
- **Context**: "If previously it was the knowledge economy, now it's like the taste economy"

### AI's Current Limitation is Variance, Not Capability
- **Insight**: AI can produce extraordinary volume of work, but the variability in quality creates the need for human curation
- **Description**: The competitive advantage of AI is quantity of good work in short time. The persistent weakness is inconsistent quality across outputs. This variance gap is the human employment zone
- **Context**: "The main competitive advantage of artificial intelligence right now is it can produce an extraordinarily high quantity of pretty good work in a very short period of time... the issue is there is variance in the quality of the outputs"

### Mirror Neurons Make Humans Uniquely Qualified for Taste Work
- **Insight**: Humans are biologically optimized to predict what other humans want because they ARE human - this is the most natural possible job
- **Description**: Selecting what resonates with humans is fundamentally a human skill. It leverages our deepest cognitive abilities - empathy, shared experience, social intuition
- **Context**: "What really exercises our cognitive faculties more than demonstrating taste for what other human beings want? We have mirror neurons. We obviously know what the human experience is like because we are human beings"

### Balaji's Framework is Directionally Correct but Overspecified
- **Insight**: Preparing context for AI models is the right macro-direction, but strict requirements around naming conventions, ordering, and English-only are unlikely to persist
- **Description**: Models are already handling unstructured voice dumps, multilingual input, and disorganized context effectively. The principle of context preparation matters; the specific format requirements will relax
- **Context**: "I don't think we're going to have to name everything correctly... the order of things is probably also not going to be that big of a deal"

### Algorithms Already Demonstrate Post-Taste AI Capability
- **Insight**: Social media recommendation algorithms prove that AI can eventually surpass human taste - this is a temporary economic window, not a permanent moat
- **Description**: Your Facebook/Instagram/Twitter feed already knows what you want to see better than you do. When LLMs reach that level of personalization, the taste economy window closes
- **Context**: "After a few days, months, or even years, these things tend to know what you want to see better than you know yourself. But that's not for now. That's eventually"

### Context Quality Directly Correlates to Output Quality
- **Insight**: The quality of examples you provide to a model is the single highest-leverage variable in determining output quality
- **Description**: Better examples → better outputs is the foundational principle. This makes example curation the most valuable skill in any AI-augmented workflow
- **Context**: "The more high-quality examples we can provide a model, the better the quality of those examples on average, typically the better the quality of the output"

### AI Model Representatives Will Need Your Decision-Making Context
- **Insight**: As AI agents represent you in meetings, emails, and decisions, they'll need organized examples of YOUR decision-making patterns to function effectively
- **Description**: The coming wave of autonomous AI agents joining calls, filtering emails, and making decisions on your behalf creates demand for curated decision-making context libraries
- **Context**: "It's going to be organizing your notes in such a way that a model can get a clear example of your own decision-making if confronted with some sort of decision"

## Examples

### Email Autoresponder Context Curation
- **Example**: Building an email autoresponder by scrolling through Gmail inbox to find high-quality email examples rather than writing prompt instructions
- **Description**: Instead of describing what a good email looks like (zero-shot), copy-paste actual emails you like into the prompt (few-shot). The work IS the scrolling and selecting
- **Context**: "When you found a good quality email, something that you like, what you do is you just copy and paste that puppy into a prompt"

### Thumbnail Generation QA Workflow
- **Example**: Johan's thumbnail generator creates 8 variations in seconds; human selects the best one
- **Description**: AI generates candidates at scale, human collapses the possibility space down to the single best output through taste-based selection
- **Context**: "What I'm really doing there is I'm collapsing the total space of all possible generations down into just the one generation which is actually good"

### N8N Workflow JSON Collection
- **Example**: Copying workflow JSONs from proven automations as few-shot context for building new workflows
- **Description**: Existing workflow JSONs serve as high-quality examples that teach AI what maintainable, well-structured automations look like. The curation of which JSONs to include IS the work
- **Context**: "The JSON ends up looking just like this. It's a collection of text... I'm applying my human intuition to know what flows are good"

### Facebook Ad Library Curation
- **Example**: Scrolling through Facebook Ad Library to select ads that resonate viscerally, then using those as training data for ad generators
- **Description**: Select 20 strong candidates, run them in tests, identify top performers by CTR/CVR, then feed winners into model as context. Human taste pre-filters, data validates
- **Context**: "You go on Facebook ad library, scrolling through and getting ads that speak to you on a visceral level... you'll probably select 20 good candidates, run them side by side"

### Personal Brand Reference Library
- **Example**: Building a reference library of self-images and brand elements to improve thumbnail/content generation consistency
- **Description**: The quality of personal brand AI outputs depends entirely on the quality of the reference library - curated photos, style guides, and brand examples
- **Context**: "A big chunk of why that thumbnail generator works is because we have a very high quality reference library of images of both myself and then some other things"

### AI Agent Decision-Making Context
- **Example**: Organizing personal notes about past decisions so AI agents can emulate your decision-making style
- **Description**: Notes on how you've approached specific situations become training data for autonomous agents that represent you. More examples = better representation
- **Context**: "Giving them notes on maybe how you've approached certain specific situations in the past and how you want the model to approach them again in the future"

## Action Items

### Build a Personal Reference Library Immediately
- **Action**: Start curating high-quality examples in your domain (emails, workflows, designs, copy) into organized folders
- **Description**: This library IS your professional asset. The quality and breadth of your example library directly determines the quality of AI outputs you can produce. Begin accumulating today
- **Context**: Directly supports few-shot prompting methodology - the more examples you have, the better your outputs

### Develop Systematic Taste Through Exposure
- **Action**: Deliberately expose yourself to high volumes of output in your domain and practice rapid quality assessment
- **Description**: Scroll through ad libraries, email examples, design portfolios, and workflow repositories daily. Build your intuition for what "good" looks like through massive repeated exposure
- **Context**: "Human taste itself grows more distinguished through massive and repeated exposure"

### Offer QA-as-a-Service to AI-Using Businesses
- **Action**: Position yourself as the human quality layer for businesses generating AI content, designs, or automations at scale
- **Description**: Companies generating thousands of AI outputs need someone with calibrated taste to select the best ones. This is an immediately sellable service requiring no technical infrastructure
- **Context**: "You're going to be that last line of defense, that human bastion against the darkness that just selects the best quality results"

### Create Workflow JSON Libraries for Your Niche
- **Action**: Collect, organize, and document high-quality N8N/Make.com workflow JSONs for specific use cases
- **Description**: Build categorized libraries of proven workflow patterns. These become your competitive advantage in automation delivery - the quality of your templates determines your output quality
- **Context**: "Looking for very high-quality examples of the sorts of flows that I like to build, the sorts of flows that I think are maintainable, that offer me good error logging"

### Implement the Generate-Then-Select Workflow
- **Action**: For every deliverable, generate 5-10x variants using AI then select the best through human review rather than trying to craft one perfect output
- **Description**: Stop spending time on single-pass creation. Shift to high-volume generation followed by taste-based selection. This is the optimal human-AI collaboration pattern
- **Context**: "Generate lots of stuff and then basically you just have a human do QA"

### Build Decision-Making Documentation
- **Action**: Start documenting your decision-making processes, reasoning patterns, and situational responses for future AI agent context
- **Description**: As AI agents take over more representative functions (meetings, emails, decisions), they'll need your documented decision-making patterns. Start building this context library now
- **Context**: "What's one of the best ways to make sure that these things think like you do? It's going to be organizing your notes"

### Practice Voice-First Context Delivery
- **Action**: Use voice transcription tools (Whisper, native OS dictation) to rapidly dump context into AI tools instead of typing carefully structured prompts
- **Description**: Voice input at 150+ WPM delivers context far faster than typing at 40-80 WPM. Trust models to organize your spoken context. This multiplies your context preparation speed
- **Context**: "They'll just turn on their voice transcription tool and then talk a ton... 30 to 60 seconds"

### Start the Ad Creative Curation Pipeline
- **Action**: Create a daily practice of scrolling Facebook Ad Library, saving high-performing ads, categorizing by style/industry/hook type
- **Description**: This curated ad library becomes a sellable asset and a competitive advantage for any ad generation or marketing service you offer
- **Context**: "Most of your future work is probably going to involve finding and then organizing really high-quality ads for some sort of ad creative or ad copy generator"

## Creator Context

**Creator Background**: Nick Saraev has been working with AI since GPT-2 era, scaling an automation agency to $70K/month. This video represents his philosophical framework for where economic value is heading, synthesizing his practical experience building thousands of automations with his understanding of AI capability curves.

**Content Style**: Reflective and philosophical daily update, drawing from practical automation experience to support a macro thesis about the future of work. Uses concrete examples (email autoresponders, thumbnail generators, N8N workflows, Facebook ads) to ground abstract economic theory.

**Target Audience**: Knowledge workers, automation professionals, and entrepreneurs trying to understand where to invest their time and skill development. Particularly relevant for anyone feeling anxious about AI displacement - reframes the narrative toward human-AI collaboration through taste and context curation.

**Cross-Reference Notes**: 
- **Video #26 (749 Days)**: This video's "context preparation" thesis builds directly on the "unsexy work" philosophy - the most valuable work doesn't look impressive, it looks like scrolling through inboxes
- **Prompt Engineering Masterclass**: The few-shot vs zero-shot framework was covered with specific accuracy metrics there (40% → 60% → 67%); this video extends it into an economic philosophy
- **Video #25 (Affiliate/Networking)**: The 1,200 customer interactions principle connects - volume of exposure builds the taste that becomes economically valuable
- **AI Frontrunners Vibe Coding**: Production readiness and QA themes connect - the "variance in AI outputs" problem is the same problem solved differently in each context
- **Video #22 (Inbound Optimization)**: Speed-to-lead and AI-powered personalization are practical implementations of the taste economy - knowing WHICH personalization resonates is the taste component
